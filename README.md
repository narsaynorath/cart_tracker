# Cart Tracker
Have you ever gone grocery shopping with a budget in mind, only to get to the counter and 
realize that you've gone way over budget? __Fear no more!__

Have people ever told you the best way to stay within your budget is to carry a calculator
with you when shopping, but you're always afraid of making a mistake? __Fear no more!__

This mobile application aims to provide you with a reasonable estimate of the total in
your shopping cart so you can control your spending *before* the point of no return 💸

# Technical-ish stuff
I began this project with the goal of exploring new development ideas and technologies. 
I've decided to use __React Native__ as the primary framework along with modern
tools such as:
* __Prettier__ for code consistency
* __Storybook__ for visual TDD

More tools and concepts will be added to this list as I get further into this project!
