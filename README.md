# Cart Tracker

Have you ever gone grocery shopping with a budget in mind, only to get to the counter and
realize that you've gone way over budget? **Fear no more!**

Have people ever told you the best way to stay within your budget is to carry a calculator
with you when shopping, but you're always afraid of making a mistake? **Fear no more!**

This iOS app aims to provide you with a reasonable estimate of the total in your shopping cart
so you can control your spending _before_ the point of no return 💸

# Technical-ish stuff

I began this project with the goal of exploring new development ideas and technologies.
I've decided to use **React Native** as the primary framework along with modern
tools such as:

- **Prettier** for code consistency
- **Storybook** for visual TDD

More tools and concepts will be added to this list as I get further into this project!
